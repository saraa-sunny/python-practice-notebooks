# 📝Python Practice Notebooks

This repository contains my daily Python practice.
I created it to improve my data analysis skills step by step.

It includes simple exercises on:

🔸 Basic Python (loops, lists, functions)

🔸 Working with data using pandas and NumPy

🔸 Data cleaning tasks

🔸 Small EDA (exploratory data analysis) questions

🔸 Mini practice problems to build confidence

I am using these exercises to learn by doing and stay consistent.
